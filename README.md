 <br>Zelcord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight. 
</div>

# Features

- **Standalone client** 

   Zelcord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way.

- **Various mods built-in**
 
   Enjoy [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord), [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter) and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!

- **Themes**

   Zelcord natively supports theming of the entire app, you can easily import BetterDiscord themes and manage them

- **Made for Privacyâ„¢**

   Zelcord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure!

- **Supports Rich Presence**

   Unlike other clients, Zelcord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to [arRPC](https://arrpc.openasar.dev).
   
- **Mobile support**

   Zelcord has **experimental** mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.

- **Much more stable**

   Zelcord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.


- **Cross-platform support!**

   Zelcord was originally created for ARM64 Linux devices since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://github.com/electron/electron#platform-support)!

# FAQ
## Do you have a support Discord?

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/TnhxcqynZ2)](https://discord.gg/TnhxcqynZ2)
## Will I get banned for using this?   
- You are breaking [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services) by using Zelcord, but no one has been banned from using it or any of the client mods included.

## Can I use this on anything other than ARM?
- Yes! Zelcord should work normally under Windows, MacOS, and Linux as long as it has Electron support.  

## How can I access the settings?
- Either right-click on the tray icon and click `Open Settings` or open Discord settings and scroll down the sidebar until you see information about versions. Click on the Zelcord version and the settings window will pop out.

## How does this work?   
- We are using the official web app and wrapping it up in Electron. While you may think this is lame and done like thousands of times before, what makes us unique is that we actually strive for creating a customized experience. You can very easily load themes and mods with no installers/injectors. You can even make the client have transparency effects and follow the fluent design of Windows! At its core, it's just a simple web wrapper, however, we applied many patches to make this work well for you <3

## Why is macOS support lacking?
- Due to me not owning any macOS device, I can't easily debug/test or do anything related to it. Of course, VMs and Hackintosh machines exist but from my experience, these are unreliable or very time-consuming to set up and maintain. While Zelcord "works" on macOS you may encounter weird issues or inconsistencies with other apps in terms of how they behave (for example macOS lack of tray).

## Where can I find the source code?
- The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zelcord/Zelcord/).

## Where can I translate this?
- Translations are done using our [Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/Zelcord/Zelcord/).
